\chapter{Time plan outline}
Time plan outline is defined for full period of study contracted within MarineUAS project. first year is planed as "Problem understanding period". Main activities planned for this year involves course passing and preliminary topics definition. Both summer and winter vacations are incorporated into plan.

Second year is planned as: "From learning to understanding and researching". First half of year is dedicated to active scientific cooperation between Honeywell and universities in field of optimal trajectory calculation and obstacle space segmentation. Because platform will be build at this time, some preliminary flights and tests will be executed. First publication results to be expected.
