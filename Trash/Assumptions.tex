\section{Assumptions}

These are following assumptions which limit possible solution:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item There exist real-time point cloud from Lidar with some degree of uncertainty.
	\item There exist obstacle map in global coordinates in optimalised representation.
	\item There exist vehicle sensor reading for roll, pitch, yaw, heading velocity
	\item There exist estimated vehicle global position is reading with some degree of uncertainty.
	\item Operation space does not contain trap caves and nonconvex obstacles.
	\item Operation mission plan is given, and optimal trajectory is calculated (for the first iteration)
\end{enumerate}
