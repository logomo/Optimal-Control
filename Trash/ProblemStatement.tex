\section{Problem statement}

The goal of the research is to provide robust navigation control which will solve intermediate and predicted obstacle avoidance using LiDAR technology.
Problem can be split into following sub-problems, which are separable:
\begin{enumerate}
    

    \item  \textit{Data fusion} - processing reachable environment of the vehicle into unified and compact data representation for obstacle detection.
		
    \item  \textit{Real-time reactive obstacle avoidance} - detect possible obstacles and calculate possible safety margins regarding obstacle avoidance, given reachability set should be used as a constraint for optimal control regarding obstacle avoidance.
    
\end{enumerate}
